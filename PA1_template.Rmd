## Loading and preprocessing the data

activity.data = read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
activity.data = mutate(activity.data, date = as.Date(activity_data$date, "%Y-%m-%d"), interval = as.factor(interval))

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

steps.per.day = ddply(activity.data, .(date), summarize, total.steps = sum(steps))
step.totals = with(steps.per.day, total.steps[!is.na(total.steps)])
hist(step.totals, breaks = 10)
mean(step.totals)
median(step.totals)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

with(subset(steps.per.day, !is.na(total.steps)), plot(date, total.steps, type="l"))

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
